# Embedded systems

This is our semester project for the _Embedded systems and robotics_ course at EPFL from [Prof. Francesco Mondada](https://people.epfl.ch/102717?lang=en). We had to control an E-Puck2 using its real-time OS, C++, and its different sensors and actuators. The robot had to find the highest point of a plane, go there, and bounce on the edge like a Tennis ball.
